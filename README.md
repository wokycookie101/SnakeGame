# Overview

This is the classic game of Snake. The snake starts off with being a certain length. Then, random apples will appear on the screen, and you need to be able to control the snake using the arrow keys to eat the apples. The more apples it eats, the bigger it gets.

# Development Environment

I used Java as my main langauge to develop this code. I also developed in inside Visual Studio Code. 

I also used the javax, java.awt, java.swing, and the random imports for this game as well.

# Future Work

- I want to try adding looping sides so that it won't be so easy to lose. 
- Maybe multiplayer mode?
- Maybe I could find a way to generate more apples on the screen.
